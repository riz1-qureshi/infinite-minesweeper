Minesweeper, but make it infinite...

Play it here: https://riz1-qureshi.github.io/infinite-minesweeper/

Updates to do:
- Add Medium, Hard, and Extreme difficulties (they used to be there but I removed them for simplicity)
- Add keyboard button instructions somewhere
- At game over, show a full map of explored area
- Allow pinch to zoom for mobile gamers
- Encorporate some sort of scoring system?
- Allow seeded runs??
- Add texture packs???
